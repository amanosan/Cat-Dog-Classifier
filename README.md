# Cat-Dog-Classifier
Learning ConvNets by classifying Cats and Dogs using Tensorflow and Keras.


### Getting the Data:
The Data has been taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). <br/>
Rename the directory with all the images to "original_data". <br/>
Run the make_data.py script for getting a smaller version of the dataset into appropriate directories. <br/>

##### NOTE: The notebook has been implemented on Google Colab, so you will have to edit the paths accordingly.
